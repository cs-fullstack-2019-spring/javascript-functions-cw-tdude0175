//Create a sumOf3Numbers function that will print out the sum of the three numbers using the starting code below:
//
// var number1 = 0;
// var number2 = 0;
// var number3 = 0;
//
// sumOf3Numbers(number1, number2, number3);

copy paste the saved var for time.
function name is easy enough, don't have to rework variables
does the function or do the variables need to come first?
variables don't need to come first unly need to be used.
console.log is useful for saving information into the console
but impractical for saving information over long time
password test in problem 4 doesn't need to console.log every input
